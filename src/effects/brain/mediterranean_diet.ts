/**
 * Mediterranean-type diet — brain.
 *
 * Observational cohorts associate higher Mediterranean-diet adherence with
 * larger total brain / cortical volumes and less atrophy (e.g. Luciano M, et
 * al. Neurology. 2017;88(5):449-455. DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000003559), but
 * these are observational associations, not a randomized structural effect
 * size. To respect the "cited RCT/meta-analysis or exclude" rule, no
 * structural point estimate is asserted; this effect is marked unverified and
 * excluded from computation. Documented in evidence.md as observational.
