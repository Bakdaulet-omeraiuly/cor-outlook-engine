 * Smoking cessation — brain.

 * Smoking is associated with accelerated cortical thinning, and cessation with
 * partial recovery over years (Karama S, et al. Mol Psychiatry.
 * 2015;20(6):778-785. DOI: 10.1038/mp.2014.187), but this is observational and
 * not a randomized structural effect size usable as a point estimate. No
 * number invented; marked unverified and excluded. Documented in evidence.md.
