 * 2019;322(6):524-534. DOI: 10.1001/jama.2019.10551
 * Intensive BP control slowed accumulation of white-matter-lesion volume
 * (intensive +0.92 cm^3 vs standard +1.45 cm^3 median increase over ~4 y) and
 * was associated with a small reduction in total brain volume.
 *
 * This library's brain model does not expose a white-matter-lesion parameter
 * in v0.1, and SPRINT MIND did NOT report a hippocampal-volume increase from
 * BP control. Therefore no hippocampal or cortical-thickness number is
 * invented here; the measured white-matter benefit is documented in
 * evidence.md and this structural-parameter effect is marked unverified.
 *
 * The cognitive benefit (reduced MCI) is from the primary SPRINT MIND report:
 * Williamson JD, et al. JAMA. 2019;321(6):553-561.
 * DOI: 10.1001/jama.2018.21442  (outcome, not a structural parameter here).
