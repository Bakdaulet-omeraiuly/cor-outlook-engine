 * Weight reduction reduced LV mass substantially and independently of BP.

 * Corroborated by: Cuspidi C, et al. "Effects of bariatric surgery on cardiac
 * structure and function: a systematic review and meta-analysis."
 * Am J Hypertens. 2014;27(2):146-156. DOI: 10.1093/ajh/hpt215
 * (LV mass standardized mean difference -0.46, p<0.001).
 *
 * Non-surgical weight loss effect modeled conservatively as -0.08 relative on
 * LVMI with a wide CI (-0.03 to -0.14), smaller than bariatric magnitudes.
