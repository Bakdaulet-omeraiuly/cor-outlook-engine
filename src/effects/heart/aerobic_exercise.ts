/**
 * Aerobic exercise — heart.
 *
 * Endurance exercise produces physiological LV adaptation. A clean,
 * *disease-regression* LV mass index number for ~150 min/week aerobic exercise
 * in a general cohort is not cleanly separable from athlete remodeling (where
 * LV mass may increase physiologically). To avoid misrepresenting athletic
 * hypertrophy as pathological regression, the LVMI effect is left unverified
 * and excluded. Exercise's blood-pressure benefit is documented in evidence.md.
