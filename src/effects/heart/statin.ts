 * Statin — effect on LV structural parameters.
 *
 * Statins have robust outcome evidence (e.g. CTT Collaboration, Lancet 2010,
 * DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61350-5) but a *direct, quantified* effect on
 * LV mass index / wall thickness as a structural regression is NOT established
 * by a clean meta-analysis. Rather than invent a structural number, the LVMI
 * effect is left unverified (excluded from computation).
 *
 * We do NOT claim a structural LVMI change here without a numeric source.
