/**
 * ACE inhibitor / ARB — LV mass regression.
 *
 * Klingbeil AU, Schneider M, Martus P, Messerli FH, Schmieder RE.
 * "A meta-analysis of the effects of treatment on left ventricular mass in
 * essential hypertension." Am J Med. 2003;115(1):41-46.
 * DOI: 10.1016/S0002-9343(03)00158-X
 * Reported LVMI reduction: ARB -13% (95% CI 8-18%), ACE inhibitor -10%
 * (95% CI 8-12%). We model the class with a pooled central estimate of -11%
 * and a CI spanning both agents' reported bounds (-8% to -15%).
 *
 * LV wall thickness tracks mass regression but the meta-analysis reports mass,
 * not wall thickness, so a wall-thickness point estimate is NOT directly
 * sourced here and is left unverified rather than invented.
