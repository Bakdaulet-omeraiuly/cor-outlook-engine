 * Dietary sodium reduction — LV mass.

 * Sodium restriction lowers blood pressure (He FJ, Li J, MacGregor GA.
 * "Effect of longer term modest salt reduction on blood pressure." BMJ.
 * 2013;346:f1325. DOI: 10.1136/bmj.f1325). A *direct* quantified effect on LV
 * mass index attributable to sodium reduction independent of BP is not
 * cleanly established by a dedicated meta-analysis. To avoid inventing a
 * structural number, the LVMI effect here is modeled as small and marked
 * unverified (excluded from computation); the BP-lowering mechanism is
 * documented in evidence.md.
